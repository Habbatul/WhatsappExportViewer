### WhatsApp Exported .txt Viewer


## About The Project

This web application (PWA) allows you to display WhatsApp chat logs saved in .txt format in a more readable format, similar to the original WhatsApp (note: the styling will not be identical). The app is built using vanilla JavaScript and CSS, so no special setup is required to run it locally. 

**Update** : I've added a datepicker from jQuery for date input. You can check the minimum library I'm using in the jQuery folder in this repo.

### Features

- **Lazy Loading**: Loads data as you scroll, ensuring the app remains lightweight and efficient.
- **DOM Fragment**: Utilizes DOM fragments for better performance.
- **Keyword Filter**: Filter messages based on keywords.
- **Date Filter**: Filter messages based on dates.
- **PWA**: This application can be installed as an app on your Android phone.
- **Date Indicator**: A date indicator above the chat container shows the date of the current chat view. The date indicator is displayed below the chat group of that particular date. You can also hold on a chat bubble to see the exact date of that chat.

### Current Limitations

- Currently, the app only supports displaying chats in text format.
