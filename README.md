### WhatsApp Exported .txt Viewer


## About The Project

This web application allows you to display WhatsApp chat logs saved in .txt format in a more readable format, similar to the original WhatsApp (note: the styling will not be identical). The app is built using vanilla JavaScript and CSS, so no special setup is required to run it locally.


### Features

- Lazy Loading: Loads data as you scroll, ensuring the app remains lightweight and efficient.
- DOM Fragment: Utilizes DOM fragments for better performance.
- Keyword Filter: Filter messages based on keywords.
- Date Filter: Filter messages based on dates.

### Current Limitations

- Currently, the app only supports displaying chats in text format.
